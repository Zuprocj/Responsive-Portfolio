# Responsive-Portfolio

Added media querry to make basic portfolio a more responisve.  Learned that it is easier to start small then work up in size to get the layout to look like the reference pictures that were provided.  I couldn't make the nav bar look like the picture on smallest screen.  I know I had to move the text to align in the center but it didn't budge.  I left the code that I was trying as a comment.  I have a greater appreciation of bootstrap grid system.
